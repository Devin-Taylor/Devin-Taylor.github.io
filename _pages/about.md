I am currently working as a software engineer at [Nedbank CIB](https://www.nedbank.co.za/content/nedbank/desktop/gt/en/corporates/About-CIB.html) where I focus on designing and implementing algorithmic trading strategies and the associated software platform.

In 2019 I graduated with distinction from the MPhil in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Cambridge, where I was chosen as the 2018 recipient of the Nedbank Masters Scholarship. My research was conducted under the supervision of [Professor Pietro Li√≤](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/) and focussed on *interpretable cross-modal deep learning*. The research resulted in an extended abstract being published at the ML4H workshop at NeurIPS, which focussed on [cross-modal deep learning for Parkison's disease](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.06442). The work was kindly outlined by Pietro in an article in [The Ring Journal](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/sites/www.cst.cam.ac.uk/files/theringjan2020.pdf).

From the end of 2015 to 2018 I worked as a data scientist at [Isazi](https://isazi.ai/) where I spent the majority of my time as the technical lead in product development for [Sophia](https://isazi.ai/sophia.html), an end-to-end automated, machine learning driven data capturing solution. Prior to working on Sophia, I assumed roles as machine learning researcher and data science consultant. My research was centered around the application of machine learning to the medical domain, my primary area of interest in machine learning. This research resulted in a two year collaboration with the University of San Francisco.

Prior to Isazi I completed my undergraduate degrees in Electrical Engineering and Biomedical Engineering at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa.

In my personal time I try to give back as much as possible to the machine learning community in Africa by assisting with the tutorials for the African [Deep Learning Indaba](http://www.deeplearningindaba.com/) and being part of the [IndabaX South Africa](https://indabax.co.za/) organisation committee.
